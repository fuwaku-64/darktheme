## Free Platform Access:

## Allow users to access and use the basic features of the platform for free. This can include profile creation, collaboration discovery, and basic project management tools.
## Revenue Sharing Fee:

## Implement a revenue sharing model where the app takes a percentage of the earnings generated from each track or collaboration facilitated through the platform. This percentage can be deducted automatically when earnings are distributed.
Perpetual Fee Deduction:

## Deduct the perpetual fee from the earnings of the track whenever revenue is generated. This fee could be a fixed percentage of the revenue generated or a flat fee per project.
Transparent Earnings Tracking:

## Ensure that users have clear visibility into their earnings, including the amount deducted as the perpetual fee.
Optional Premium Features:

## Offer additional premium features or services that users can opt for, such as advanced analytics, promotion tools, or faster revenue distribution, for a separate fee.
User-Friendly Payment Process:

## Make the process of deducting the perpetual fee seamless and user-friendly, ensuring that it aligns with the platform's mission of supporting collaboration and revenue sharing.
Fair Revenue Distribution:

## Ensure that revenue distribution to all collaborators is automated and transparent, with each party receiving their share after the perpetual fee deduction.
This revenue model encourages users to collaborate on your platform, as they are not required to pay upfront for basic access. Instead, they pay a percentage of their earnings when their collaborative projects generate revenue. This can be an attractive proposition for musicians, producers, and other professionals who want to minimize upfront costs while benefiting from the platform's services.
